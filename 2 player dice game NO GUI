    Player2_W=0

    while Round !=4:
        print("Round"+str(Round))
        Player1= dice_roll()
        Player2= dice_roll()
        print("player1="+str(Player1))
        print("player2=" + str(Player2))
        if Player1==Player2:
            pass
        elif Player1>Player2:
            Player1_W=Player1_W +1
        else :
            Player2_W= Player2_W +1
        Round=Round+1
    print("Player1 round won:",Player1_W)
    print("Player2 round won:", Player2_W)
    if Player1_W==Player2_W:
        print("DRAW")
